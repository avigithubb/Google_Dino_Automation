# Google_Dino_Automation
<h1>About</h1>
<p>This repository is based on Google's Dino game, but with a twist â€“ it's automated! The Dinosaur Game is a browser game developed by Google and built into the Google Chrome web browser. The player guides a pixelated Tyrannosaurus rex across a side-scrolling landscape, avoiding obstacles to achieve a higher score. In this automated version, the dino will navigate through each of the obstacles on its own, requiring no manual intervention.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The code for this project uses Python along with image processing techniques utilizing NumPy arrays and Pillow. Additionally, PyAutoGUI is used to simulate spacebar hits for the dino to jump over obstacles.</p>

<h2>Tech Used</h2>
<h4>Python:</h4> <p>The main programming language used for the automation.</p>
<h4>NumPy:</h4> <p>For efficient array operations and image processing.</p>
<h4>Pillow:</h4> <p>For handling image-related tasks.</p>
<h4>PyAutoGUI:</h4> <p>To simulate keyboard actions (e.g., hitting the spacebar).</p>
<h2>How to Use</h2>
<h4>Ensure Python is Installed:</h4>
<p>Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download it from python.org.</p>

<h4>Clone the Repository:</h4>
<p>Pull this repository and open it in your preferred code editor.</p>
<span><em>git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-dino-game.git</em></span><br>
<span><em>cd automated-dino-game</em></span>
<h4>Install Required Libraries:</h4>
<p>Install all the required libraries listed in the requirements.txt file.</p>
<span><em>pip install -r requirements.txt</em></span>

<h4>Run the Script:</h4>
<p>Execute the script to start the automation.</p>
<span><em>python main.py</em></span>

<h4>Open the Dino Game:</h4>
<p>Open the Chrome Dino game. The recommended site is elgoog.im/dinosaur-game. If you choose another site, adjust the screen pixels in the code as necessary.</p>

<h4>Watch the Magic:</h4>
<p>Sit back and watch as the dino automatically navigates through obstacles without any manual commands.</p>
